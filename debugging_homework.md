As an introduction to debugging:
- watch the following video: [Intro to Debugging video](https://youtu.be/ErVZrVWZrko)


Answer the following questions:
1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?

a breakpoint is an intentional stopping or pausing place in a program, put in place for debugging purposes

2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
no, breakpoint suspends program just before the line executes

3. How do we debug the next line of code?
Using the step over command

4. What does the step into command do?
This literally "Steps into" a line of cone to present what happened within it - which is useful when you don't know if the result it's returning is correct

5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?
Evaluate calculates values of a given piece of code; expression limits it to one line where as code fragments during the debugging session lets yo uevaluate multiple lkines of code.
